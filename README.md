Study Notes, Methods, and Outcomes

Hello everyone

I'm Motlalepula and I am very interested in learning how to code and I hope to learn a lot from the collective. I enjoy learning new things and facing speccial challenges and I never give up until I have found the solution to a problem. I look forward to a fruitful journey and I hope we will all make it where we want and need to be in life.
